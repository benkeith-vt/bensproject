## Project Overview

After seeing somke of Mohit Bhoite's sculptures online, I would like to try to recreate some in my own way. I have attempted to do some of the work over the summer on my own but have had little success. I believe if  have some assistance from a more expirienced member of the community, the work will become much more insightful and enjoyable.

## Educational Value Added

The technical work preformed on this project I believe will be very educational for my work in electrical engineering. I also think that this project will help me in the future in which I would like to work with micro-electronics, something that goes hand and hand with what I would like to do.
